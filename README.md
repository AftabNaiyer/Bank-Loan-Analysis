# Bank Loan Analysis Project

## 📌 Overview
This project analyzes **bank loan applications** using **Excel and SQL**. It aims to help financial institutions assess **loan approvals, defaults, interest rates, and borrower profiles** by leveraging structured data analysis. The project involves:

- **Data Cleaning & Processing**: Handling missing values, standardizing data formats, and creating a processed dataset.
- **SQL Query Analysis**: Extracting meaningful insights using optimized SQL queries.
- **Loan Risk Assessment**: Identifying **good vs. bad loans** and understanding borrower risk factors.
- **Excel Dashboard Visualization**: Utilizing **Pivot Tables & Charts** to display key financial metrics.
- **Business Insights**: Providing a structured approach to evaluate **default rates, loan terms, and borrower behavior**.

By integrating SQL-based analytics with Excel-based dashboards, this project delivers a comprehensive **financial decision-making tool** that can be used by banks to monitor lending performance and mitigate risks.

## 📌 SQL Queries Used
```sql
-- Total Loan Applications
SELECT COUNT(id) AS Total_Applications FROM bank_loan_data;

-- Monthly Loan Applications Trend
SELECT MONTH(issue_date) AS Loan_Month, COUNT(id) AS Total_Applications 
FROM bank_loan_data GROUP BY Loan_Month ORDER BY Loan_Month;

-- Loan Default Rate Calculation
SELECT (COUNT(CASE WHEN loan_status = 'Charged Off' THEN id END) * 100.0) / COUNT(id) AS Default_Rate 
FROM bank_loan_data;

-- Average Debt-to-Income Ratio
SELECT AVG(dti) AS Avg_DTI FROM bank_loan_data;

-- Loan Distribution by Purpose
SELECT purpose, COUNT(id) AS Loan_Count FROM bank_loan_data GROUP BY purpose ORDER BY Loan_Count DESC;

-- Loan Amount Distribution by State
SELECT address_state, SUM(loan_amount) AS Total_Loan_Amount FROM bank_loan_data GROUP BY address_state;

-- Interest Rate Analysis
SELECT grade, AVG(int_rate) AS Avg_Interest_Rate FROM bank_loan_data GROUP BY grade ORDER BY Avg_Interest_Rate DESC;
```
